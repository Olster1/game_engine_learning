### Perspective matrix

## Graphics
Very good site for learning about 3d graphics.
Covers materials, lights, shadow mapping & more advance topics like SSAO, Bloom, Deffered Shading.  
https://learnopengl.com

### 2d games

Good overview on how to use the graphics card efficiently in 2d games (batching draw calls together & reducing change of shaders & other state). Also very relevant to 3d.
